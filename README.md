# coverage-strike
Coverage Strike is an AI-powered mutation testing library for JavaScript and TypeScript that strikes at the weak points in your test coverage. It intelligently mutates your code and uses AI to prioritise impactful mutations, helping you uncover silent failures, missing assertions, and untested logic paths.
